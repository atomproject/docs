# How theming works across elements and pages

We use a theme file which contains the value for various colour and font variables. Then for each project, the elements only make use of a subset of these variables. An interface is available to the user, using which values of these variables can be changed. As any value is changed, its effect is reflected across all instances of every element in the project immediately.
