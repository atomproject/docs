# How does the property panel work? 

As mentioned above, the property panel for each element gets auto generated from a part of the element definition. The property panel is basically a form, which generally uses items like checkboxes, input fields, dropdowns, pill buttons and sliders. Hence, based on the data type of the  property to be exposed, a relevant UI control is chosen to display it.Â 

Changing something in the property panel sets or modifies the value of an attribute in the custom HTML tag of the corresponding element. This results in changing the appearance or behaviour of the element. Users can do this on the fly and see results in real time.
