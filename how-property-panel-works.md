## What is the property panel?

The property panel is basically a form, which generally uses items like checkboxes, input fields, dropdowns, pill buttons and sliders. It is used while previewing elements, and allows the user to manipulate an elements public API via a user interface.

## How does the property panel work? 

The property panel for each element gets auto generated from a part of the element definition. Based on the data type of the  property to be exposed, a relevant UI control is chosen to display it.

Changing something in the property panel sets or modifies the value of an attribute in the custom HTML tag of the corresponding element. This results in changing the appearance or behaviour of the element. Users can do this on the fly and see results in real time.

## How to create the property panel for your element

* We currently use two sections in the property panel - Element Data & Element Properties. The former specifies data that the element needs to run or to display, while the latter is used to change configurations offered by the element.
* The property panel for any element can be generated by including a json file in the component's repository, called property.json. This file has two sections corresponding to the sections in the property panel.
* A sample code of what the property.json file looks like
```
{
    "name": "Calendar",
    "properties": [{
        "name": "Data",
        "fields": {
            "label": {
                "name": "Label",
                "type": "string",
                "value": "Select a date"
            }
        }
    }, {
        "name": "Properties",
        "fields": {
            "required": {
                "name": "Mandatory Field",
                "type": "Boolean",
                "value": true
            }
        }
    }]
}
```
Here is what that code generates

Please note, in this example, `label` and `required` are the names of properties exposed by the element's Public API. 

## Supported UI Controls

As mentioned above, the property panel is a form made up of certain types of controls. The following UI controls can be used in the property panel. Sample code snippets are provided for each.

**1. Checkbox**

```
"sortable": {
                "name":"Sortable",
                "type": "boolean",
                "value": true
            }
```

**2. Input Field**
```
"label": {
                "name": "Label",
                "type": "string",
                "value": "Select value from items"
            }
```

**3. Dropdown**
```
"mapType": {
                "name":"Select Map Type",
                "type": "options",
                "values": ["roadmap", "satellite", "hybrid", "terrain"],
                "value":"roadmap"
            }
```

**4. Icon Picker**
```
"ico": {
                "name": "Icon",
                "type": "iconset"
            }
```

**5. Data Feeder**

```
"data": {
                "name": "Choices",
                "type": "list",
                "value": []
            }
```

**6. Slider**
```
"min": {
                "name": "Min Number",
                "type": "range",
                "min": 0,
                "max": 99
            }
```

**7. Pill Button**
```
"alignment": {
                "name": "Alignment",
                "type": "options",
                "values": ["left","center","fullbleed"],
                "value":"left"
            }
```

## Known Limitations
* All properties are assumed to be independent of each other.
* There is no way of specifying mandatory properties.

<!--
Possible Additions Required
* Text String (to show value captured by an autosuggest or dropdown, etc.)
* Calendar?? (to capture excluded dates in the calendar)
* List? (to show value captured by a checkbox list. Basically any component which returns an array will need something like this)
