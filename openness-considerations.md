# Openness Considerations 

## Can i work with my own elements? 

Yes, you can use your own elements in the form and page builders, together with those provided by atom project. Simply upload your own elements, any valid polymer 1.0 component will do. See the section above ‘How do i create an atom element?’ for details on creating your custom elements.

## Must i use all of atoms tools? 

Not necessarily. The various elements and tools are designed to work independently of each other. Based on your requirement you might want to use only the form builder or the page builder or the API calling interface. These tools work well together, but you are free to use any tool of your choice, or write custom code for any part of the web app creation process and use atom’s tools for other parts.

## Developer workflow concerns 

Just like using a tool like Sublime Text for writing code does not impose any proprietary constraints on developers, using atoms form or page builder does not constrain the development workflow.

Some people would like to code in notepad, or notepad++, while others may prefer Sublime Text or Visual Studio. Similarly some people might be more comfortable hand coding forms or pages, while others may like to leverage tools like the form & page builder. 

Code generated using the form or page builder would be pure HTML with no proprietary strings attached.
